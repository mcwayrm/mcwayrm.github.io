Graphics I'm Proud Of
======

These are a colleciton of graphics I have made over time that I am proud of. I am not providing any context to any of them. Rather, I just want to show off (mostly a catalogue for myself) figures that I am happy with. I do not express in anyway to being a master of the art that is data visualization. Hope you enjoy and think, "Hey, Cool graph!"

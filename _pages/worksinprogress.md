2\. *A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Impact of Early Childhood Development on Child Health Outcomes* [Under Review]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (with [Palavi Prabhakar](https://ug.linkedin.com/in/pallavi-prabhakar-55b48485), and [Ayo Ellis](https://www.pasrc.org/members/individuals/ayo-d-ellis))

  <summary> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </summary>
      <blockquote> Investing in a child's early years can have long lasting effects in eliminating extreme poverty and boosting economic productivity. Yet, 250 million children are at risk of not reaching their full development potential in low-and-middle income countries due to inadequate nutrition and a lack of early stimulation. While substantial evidence exists on why intervening in early years is important, limited knowledge exists on which types of interventions generate substantial impact. We conduct a comprehensive review of 39 randomized controlled trials evaluating early childhood development interventions for improving children's physical health. We find that interventions including nutrition or cash based incentives work best for improving children's growth outcomes. We identify gaps in the literature, quality of evidence and intervention types for achieving Sustainable Development Goals 2, 3, and 6, as part of 2030 development agenda.

1\. *Does Board Gender Diversity and Remuneration Impact Earnings Quality? Evidence from Spanish Firms* [Under Review]
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (with [Paolo Saono](https://www.slu.edu/madrid/academics/faculty/paolo-saona.php), [Laura Muro](https://www.slu.edu/madrid/academics/faculty/laura-muro.php), and [Pablo San Martin](https://www.facea.ucsc.cl/persona/pablo-san-martin/))

  <summary> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </summary>
      <blockquote> A key function of the board of directors is ensuring earnings quality (EQ) to signal firm performance to investors and stakeholders. Using a panel of 105 non-financial Spanish listed firms from 2013 to 2018, we investigate how gender diversity on the board of directors and board remuneration influence earnings quality. The empirical method uses a Tobit semiparametric estimator with firm-industry level fixed effects and an innovative set of measures for earnings quality developed by StarMine. Our results exhibit a consistent and positive correlation of increased gender diversity on earnings quality of a firm, suggesting that a gender-balanced board of directors is associated with more transparent financial reporting and informative earnings. We also find a non-monotonic, inverse U-shaped relationship between board remuneration and earnings quality. This indicates that at a certain point, excessive board compensations lead to more opportunistic manipulation of financial reporting with the subsequent dilution of earnings quality. Increasing female representation on the board of directors and optimizing board compensation subsequently improve earnings quality. Majority of Spanish firms are both lacking in board gender diversity as well as sub-optimally remunerating their board regarding maximizing earnings quality. Policy recommendations are derived from these findings.

2\. *Setting Up a Dofile for Team Research* [Under Review]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (with [James Allen IV](https://sites.google.com/view/jamesalleniv), and [Hang Yu](https://www.econhangyu.com/home))
<details>
  <summary> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </summary>
      <blockquote> Co-authoring Dofiles can be challenging as most Stata users have idiosyncratic preferences and methods for organizing and writing Dofiles. Which standards and practices can research teams adopt to improve the cohesion of this group work? This article proposes some best practices to overcome team research coordination issues adapting methods from software engineering and data science along with personal experience with group research. We prioritize improvements that increase efficiency of the team workflow by establishing global parameters and directories, standardizing communication between team members, and enabling reproducibility of results.

1\. *Contrasting Incentives for Earnings Management: Board Activity and Board Remuneration in Spanish Firms*
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (with [Paolo Saono](https://www.slu.edu/madrid/academics/faculty/paolo-saona.php), [Laura Muro](https://www.slu.edu/madrid/academics/faculty/laura-muro.php), and [Mauricio Jara Bertin](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=A48L9BMAAAAJ&hl=en))

  <summary> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </summary>
      <blockquote> We analyze the effect board activity and board remuneration has on earnings management (EM). Our results show that more active boards are inefficient in preventing earnings manipulation. Regarding board compensation, we find a U-shaped relation indicating that excessive remuneration will lead to more earnings management. Policy recommendations are derived from the findings.

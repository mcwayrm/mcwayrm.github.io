## Working Papers


1. *A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Impact of Early Childhood Development on Child Health Outcomes* [Under Review]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (with [Palavi Prabhakar](https://ug.linkedin.com/in/pallavi-prabhakar-55b48485), and [Ayo Ellis](https://www.pasrc.org/members/individuals/ayo-d-ellis))

  <summary> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </summary>
      <blockquote> Investing in a child's early years can have long lasting effects in eliminating extreme poverty and boosting economic productivity. Yet, 250 million children are at risk of not reaching their full development potential in low-and-middle income countries due to inadequate nutrition and a lack of early stimulation. While substantial evidence exists on why intervening in early years is important, limited knowledge exists on which types of interventions generate substantial impact. We conduct a comprehensive review of 39 randomized controlled trials evaluating early childhood development interventions for improving children's physical health. We find that interventions including nutrition or cash based incentives work best for improving children's growth outcomes. We identify gaps in the literature, quality of evidence and intervention types for achieving Sustainable Development Goals 2, 3, and 6, as part of 2030 development agenda.

2. *Setting Up a Dofile for Team Research* [Under Review]

  <summary> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </summary>
      <blockquote> Co-authoring Dofiles can be challenging as most Stata users have idiosyncratic preferences and methods for organizing and writing Dofiles. Which standards and practices can research teams adopt to improve the cohesion of this group work? This article proposes some best practices to overcome team research coordination issues adapting methods from software engineering and data science along with personal experience with group research. We prioritize improvements that increase efficiency of the team workflow by establishing global parameters and directories, standardizing communication between team members, and enabling reproducibility of results.

1. *Contrasting Incentives for Earnings Management: Board Activity and Board Remuneration in Spanish Firms*
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (with [Paolo Saono](https://www.slu.edu/madrid/academics/faculty/paolo-saona.php), [Laura Muro](https://www.slu.edu/madrid/academics/faculty/laura-muro.php), and [Mauricio Jara Bertin](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=A48L9BMAAAAJ&hl=en))

  <summary> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </summary>
      <blockquote> We analyze the effect board activity and board remuneration has on earnings management (EM). Our results show that more active boards are inefficient in preventing earnings manipulation. Regarding board compensation, we find a U-shaped relation indicating that excessive remuneration will lead to more earnings management. Policy recommendations are derived from the findings.

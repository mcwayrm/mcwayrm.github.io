6\. *An Evaluation of the PEPFAR-Funded Força à Comunidade e Crianças (FCC) Program in Mozamique*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (with [Dean Yang](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/deanyang/), [James Allen IV](https://sites.google.com/view/jamesalleniv), [Arlete Mahumane](https://basis.ucdavis.edu/people/arlete-mahumane), [James Riddell IV](https://www.uofmhealth.org/profile/362/james-riddell-iv-md), and [Hang Yu](https://www.econhangyu.com/home))

  <summary> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </summary>
      <blockquote> This evaluation of the PEPFAR-funded Força à Comunidade e Crianças (FCC) program was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to identify and measure the program’s direct and indirect impacts on households with orphans and vulnerable children (OVCs) in Mozambique. Outcomes of interest included health care utilization, health outcomes, education outcomes, household economic conditions, the ability to cope with shocks and the extent to which any program impacts spilled over to households not directly enrolled. The results show that the FCC program in Mozambique had no positive impacts for any of its intermediate results and no observable impacts in nearly all outcomes of interest. The evaluation did find that the FCC program had negative outcomes in the form of reduced rates of HIV testing, reduced HIV- related knowledge, and an increase in stigmatizing attitudes about HIV. The evidence from this evaluation suggests that FCC and similar multifaceted programs may be ineffective at accomplishing their purpose or may be unintentionally adding to the challenge of responding to HIV/AIDS in Africa.

  <summary> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </summary>
      <blockquote> We collected data on individual perceptions of and plans to accept COVID-19 vaccination in Mozambique. We conducted this fourth round of data collection among study participants in Sofala, Manica, and Zambezia provinces, Mozambique, between June 2021 and September 2021.* Nearly all respondents report they will take the COVID-19 vaccine when given the chance. Of those expressing hesitancy, the main concern is the perception that vaccinations can be harmful and have potentially negative side effects. Most people believe that they are less likely to contract COVID-19 than others in their community. 100% of local leaders express support for COVID-19 vaccination.

  <summary> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </summary>
      <blockquote> We analyze how Mozambican families are coping with the economic and educational impacts of COVID-19. We conducted 3 rounds of phone interviews across 76 communities in Sofala, Manica, and Zambezia provinces of central Mozambique between July 2020 and November 2020. We find a signifcant number of families, including children, have taken on additional paid work and increased household food production to cope with the economic effects of the pandemic. Further, children have fallen behind in school, underscoring the multi-faceted burden COVID-19 has placed on children. Despite these hardships, households exhibit altruistic behavior to their neighbors.

      <blockquote> We compare how COVID-19 knowledge and behavior as well as economic conditions have changed over time in Mozambique. We conducted three rounds of phone interviews across 76 communities in Sofala, Manica, and Zambezia provinces of central Mozambique between July 10th and November 18th, 2020. We find gradual improvements in COVID-19 knowledge, persistence of some hazardous behaviors, further declines in income, and continued high levels of food insecurity.

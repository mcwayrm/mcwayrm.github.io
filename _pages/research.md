I am interested in research related broadly to Development Economics, Applied Microeconomics, Environmental Economics and Spatial Economics. 

<!-- 
  My research addresses questions such as:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  **Tourism**: How do cruise ship arrivals effect the female labor force and educational attainment in developing nations? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  **Corporate Governance**: Do female board of directors improve earnings management? Can optimizing board members compensation packages improve the quality of earnings?

1. *Cruising Through School: General Equilibrium Effects of Cruise Ship Arrivals on Employment and Education*
<details>
  <summary> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </summary>
      <blockquote> Cruise ship tourism has been the fastest growing branch of the tourism sector since the turn of the century. As a result, cruise tourism’s increased port traffic has garnered attention as a development strategy for port cities of developing nations over the past two decades. I utilize 10.6 million automatic identification system (AIS) locations from 517 cruise ships to estimate granular city by year cruise ship arrivals in 5,644 port destinations over 220 nations and territories from 2009 to 2018. Matched with 355,463 individual Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) women’s surveys in 23 countries from 2009 to 2016, this study examines cruise tourism’s relationship to female labor participation and associated human capital attainment in destination port cities of developing nations. Using fixed effects to identify this relationship, I find positive general equilibrium effects from cruise tourism on labor participation and educational attainment with strong age dynamics. For each 1% increase in cruise ship arrivals to a port city, female labor participation increase 7% and women gain around a 1/3 more years of education. Additionally, this study employs a Kaplan Meier survivorship model as well as Cox Proportional Hazard Ratios to understand the dynamic change in educational attainment related to age from a cruise tourism shock. Older women respond to an expanding service sector by seizing job opportunities, while younger women acquire a near secondary level of education in anticipation of employment opportunities. The mechanism behind tourism led growth may be the result of improvements in human capital attainment by women. Rhetoric regarding tourism’s role as a development strategy appears to be more nuanced than previously attributed when considering educational choice. This study contributes a novel micro-dataset and a novel measure for cruise tourism at a global scale to examine a broader scope of tourism’s impact on regional development and welfare effects.

2. *Contrasting Incentives for Earnings Management: Board Activity and Board Remuneration in Spanish Firms*

  <summary> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </summary>
      <blockquote> We analyze the effect board activity and board remuneration has on earnings management (EM). Our results show that more active boards are inefficient in preventing earnings manipulation. Regarding board compensation, we find a U-shaped relation indicating that excessive remuneration will lead to more earnings management. Policy recommendations are derived from the findings.

  <summary> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </summary>
      <blockquote> A key function of the board of directors is ensuring earnings quality (EQ) to signal firm performance to investors and stakeholders. Using a panel of 105 non-financial Spanish listed firms from 2013 to 2018, we investigate how gender diversity on the board of directors and board remuneration influence earnings quality. The empirical method uses a Tobit semiparametric estimator with firm-industry level fixed effects and an innovative set of measures for earnings quality developed by StarMine. Our results exhibit a consistent and positive correlation of increased gender diversity on earnings quality of a firm, suggesting that a gender-balanced board of directors is associated with more transparent financial reporting and informative earnings. We also find a non-monotonic, inverse U-shaped relationship between board remuneration and earnings quality. This indicates that at a certain point, excessive board compensations lead to more opportunistic manipulation of financial reporting with the subsequent dilution of earnings quality. Increasing female representation on the board of directors and optimizing board compensation subsequently improve earnings quality. Majority of Spanish firms are both lacking in board gender diversity as well as sub-optimally remunerating their board regarding maximizing earnings quality. Policy recommendations are derived from these findings.

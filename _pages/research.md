I am interested in research related broadly to Applied Microeconomics with concentrations in Development Economics, Impact Evaluations, Natural Disasters, Decision-making, and Urban Economics. To respond to the replication crisis as well as calls for open access and transparency, where applicable I try to provide materials related to each research item regarding working papers, replication data and code, appendix materials, survey instruments, and presentation slides. I have placed keywords alongside the research for easier navigation for specific themes in my research.

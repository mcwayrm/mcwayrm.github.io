I am interested in research related broadly to Applied Microeconomics with concentrations in Development Economics, Impact Evaluations, Natural Disasters, Decision-making, and Urban Economics. To respond to the replication crisis as well as calls for open access and transparency, where applicable I try to provide materials related to each research item regarding working papers, replication data and code, appendix materials, survey instruments, and presentation slides. I have placed keywords alongside the research for easier navigation for specific themes in my research.

1\. [*Cruising Through School: General Equilibrium Effects of Cruise Ship Arrivals on Employment and Education*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/05694345211054515?journalCode=aexb)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The American Economist, 2022, 67(1), 5 - 23

  <summary> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </summary>
      <blockquote> Cruise ship tourism has been the fastest growing branch of the tourism sector since the turn of the century. As a result, cruise tourism’s increased port traffic has garnered attention as a development strategy for port cities of developing nations over the past two decades. I utilize 10.6 million automatic identification system (AIS) locations from 517 cruise ships to estimate granular city by year cruise ship arrivals in 5,644 port destinations over 220 nations and territories from 2009 to 2018. Matched with 355,463 individual Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) women’s surveys in 23 countries from 2009 to 2016, this study examines cruise tourism’s relationship to female labor participation and associated human capital attainment in destination port cities of developing nations. Using fixed effects to identify this relationship, I find positive general equilibrium effects from cruise tourism on labor participation and educational attainment with strong age dynamics. For each 1% increase in cruise ship arrivals to a port city, female labor participation increase 7% and women gain around a 1/3 more years of education. Additionally, this study employs a Kaplan Meier survivorship model as well as Cox Proportional Hazard Ratios to understand the dynamic change in educational attainment related to age from a cruise tourism shock. Older women respond to an expanding service sector by seizing job opportunities, while younger women acquire a near secondary level of education in anticipation of employment opportunities. The mechanism behind tourism led growth may be the result of improvements in human capital attainment by women. Rhetoric regarding tourism’s role as a development strategy appears to be more nuanced than previously attributed when considering educational choice. This study contributes a novel micro-dataset and a novel measure for cruise tourism at a global scale to examine a broader scope of tourism’s impact on regional development and welfare effects.

2\. *A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Impact of Early Childhood Development on Child Health Outcomes* [Under Review]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (with [Palavi Prabhakar](https://ug.linkedin.com/in/pallavi-prabhakar-55b48485), and [Ayo Ellis](https://www.pasrc.org/members/individuals/ayo-d-ellis))
<details>
  <summary> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </summary>
      <blockquote> Investing in a child's early years can have long lasting effects in eliminating extreme poverty and boosting economic productivity. Yet, 250 million children are at risk of not reaching their full development potential in low-and-middle income countries due to inadequate nutrition and a lack of early stimulation. While substantial evidence exists on why intervening in early years is important, limited knowledge exists on which types of interventions generate substantial impact. We conduct a comprehensive review of 39 randomized controlled trials evaluating early childhood development interventions for improving children's physical health. We find that interventions including nutrition or cash based incentives work best for improving children's growth outcomes. We identify gaps in the literature, quality of evidence and intervention types for achieving Sustainable Development Goals 2, 3, and 6, as part of 2030 development agenda.

1\. *Does Board Gender Diversity and Remuneration Impact Earnings Quality? Evidence from Spanish Firms* [Under Review]
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (with [Paolo Saono](https://www.slu.edu/madrid/academics/faculty/paolo-saona.php), [Laura Muro](https://www.slu.edu/madrid/academics/faculty/laura-muro.php), and [Pablo San Martin](https://www.facea.ucsc.cl/persona/pablo-san-martin/))

  <summary> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </summary>
      <blockquote> A key function of the board of directors is ensuring earnings quality (EQ) to signal firm performance to investors and stakeholders. Using a panel of 105 non-financial Spanish listed firms from 2013 to 2018, we investigate how gender diversity on the board of directors and board remuneration influence earnings quality. The empirical method uses a Tobit semiparametric estimator with firm-industry level fixed effects and an innovative set of measures for earnings quality developed by StarMine. Our results exhibit a consistent and positive correlation of increased gender diversity on earnings quality of a firm, suggesting that a gender-balanced board of directors is associated with more transparent financial reporting and informative earnings. We also find a non-monotonic, inverse U-shaped relationship between board remuneration and earnings quality. This indicates that at a certain point, excessive board compensations lead to more opportunistic manipulation of financial reporting with the subsequent dilution of earnings quality. Increasing female representation on the board of directors and optimizing board compensation subsequently improve earnings quality. Majority of Spanish firms are both lacking in board gender diversity as well as sub-optimally remunerating their board regarding maximizing earnings quality. Policy recommendations are derived from these findings.

<details>
  <summary> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </summary>
      <blockquote> Co-authoring Dofiles can be challenging as most Stata users have idiosyncratic preferences and methods for organizing and writing Dofiles. Which standards and practices can research teams adopt to improve the cohesion of this group work? This article proposes some best practices to overcome team research coordination issues adapting methods from software engineering and data science along with personal experience with group research. We prioritize improvements that increase efficiency of the team workflow by establishing global parameters and directories, standardizing communication between team members, and enabling reproducibility of results.

      <blockquote> We collected data on individual perceptions of and plans to accept COVID-19 vaccination in Mozambique. We conducted this fourth round of data collection among study participants in Sofala, Manica, and Zambezia provinces, Mozambique, between June 2021 and September 2021.* Nearly all respondents report they will take the COVID-19 vaccine when given the chance. Of those expressing hesitancy, the main concern is the perception that vaccinations can be harmful and have potentially negative side effects. Most people believe that they are less likely to contract COVID-19 than others in their community. 100% of local leaders express support for COVID-19 vaccination.

We conducted 3 rounds of phone interviews across 76 communities in Sofala, Manica, and Zambezia provinces of central Mozambique between July 2020 and November 2020. We find a signifcant number of families, including children, have taken on additional paid work and increased household food production to cope with the economic effects of the pandemic. Further, children have fallen behind in school, underscoring the multi-faceted burden COVID-19 has placed on children. Despite these hardships, households exhibit altruistic behavior to their neighbors.

I am interested in research related broadly to applied microeconomics with concentrations in development economics, behavioral economics,environmental economics, and urban economics. 
To respond to the replication crisis as well as calls for open access and transparency, where applicable I try to provide materials related to each research item regarding working papers, replication data and code, appendix materials, survey instruments, and presentation slides. 
I have placed keywords alongside the research for easier navigation for specific themes in my research.

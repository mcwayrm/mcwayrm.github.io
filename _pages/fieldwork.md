Ryan has conducted research fieldwork in six countries either for research or supporting NGO operations.

As a practioner in the field, it is my strong belief that development outcomes are not solely limited to those living in developing countries. Many people in developed nations need our assistance in overcoming the barriers that impede their [opportunity set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_approach).

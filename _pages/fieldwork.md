Ryan has conducted research fieldwork in six countries either for research or supporting NGO operations. While all are not developing nations, the aims and focus of the fieldwork center on improving lives and developing economies. As a practioner in the field, it is his strong belief that development outcomes are not solely limited to those living in developing countries. Many people in developed nations need assistance in overcoming the barriers that impede their [opportunity set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_approach).

> From May through August of 2019, Ryan worked with [BRAC Uganda](https://bracresearch.net/aboutus.php) Independent Evaluation and Research Center (IERC) based out of Kampala, Uganda under [Danish Us Salam](https://ie.linkedin.com/in/danishussalam?challengeId=AQG1Kmziif-QgQAAAXTG8Z2HzGv6Aj0xkc5MaZvbZewt7yqwHv1i1qdOxjBWbetV8EHylU5P-bH53xHPRLMlLw2mg4zCgRN3SA&submissionId=8cd09d2f-a420-3816-c5bb-804bf174d268). During this time, he contributed to two randomized control trails (RCT) in the field. The first being BRAC's flagship program [Targeting the Ultra-Poor Graduation Program](https://www.poverty-action.org/study/variations-ultra-poor-graduation-programming-uganda) (TUP) made famous for its success in helping the poorest members of already poor communities. Ryan assisted on the endline household survey following-up on households in Luwero, Bombo, Zirobwe, Kigumba and Bweyale districts in Central Uganda. The focus of TUP is to provide the most vulnerable households in already vulnerable communities, with job training and unconditional asset transfers (eg. livestock). Additionally, this endline survey piloted the effects of the newly developed Village Savings and Lending Associations (VSLA) starting to be developed by BRAC adjacent to it's already established microfinance program. Ryan also assisted in the baseline household survey RCT for Strong Minds - Mental Health & Adolescent Empowerment (SMU) aimed at adolescent girls within Kampala. This RCT focuses on improving the mental health and wellbeing of depressed adolescent girls living in households where they are provided little agency. This is incentivized through both a unconditional cash transfer as well as local therapy groups. While living in Kampala, Ryan bought three chickens who we decided to name after economists: Ester Dufluff (Ester Duflo), Elenor Eggstrom (Elenor Ostrom), and Petra Lorenzhen (Peter Lorentzen). Ester is missed dearly.

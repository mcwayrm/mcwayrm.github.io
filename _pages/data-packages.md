This page provides the publically avaliable datasets that I have created. Feel free to use them at your disposal, but if you would please cite your sources as (Example in MLA):

> McWay, Ryan. *Name of the Dataframe*. *Version #*. *Year Updated*. *Date Extracted*. *URL*

A MLA version is provided for each dataframe. For dataframes used in replicating my previous work, please refer to my [research page](/research/) where I try to provide access to the replication code and data for my work.

Additionally, this page houses statistical packages I have created. None are perfect, so feel free to email me feedback as well as feel free to log an issue on the source code housed on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/mcwayrm).

Include Title, Data updated, Version, Quick description, link to source, Codebook or Metadata as neccessary. An MLA citation is provided for each package if you ever feel you need to cite them.

This page provides the publically avaliable datasets that I have created. Feel free to use them at your disposal, but if you would please cite your sources. A citation is provided for each dataframe. Note that some of the data listed below is not created by myself soley. Rather, some are datasets to which I have contributed towards. For these, please acknowledge all parties involved in the development of these datasets. For dataframes used in replicating my previous work, please refer to my [research page](/research/) where I try to provide access to the replication code and data for published work.

Additionally, this page houses statistical packages I have created. None are perfect, so feel free to email me feedback as well as feel free to log an issue on the source code housed on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/mcwayrm).

<!--Include Title, Data updated, Version, Quick description, link to sources to create dataframe, link to access dataframe, Codebook or Metadata as neccessary, suggested citation -->

<!-- Should work to link the data to https://datadryad.org/stash so that I can get citations on the data -->

Dataframes
------

*Cruise Ship Characteristics Information*

  > This dataframe provides a crosssection of the characteristics of cruise ship vessels currently in operation. This covers 525 vessels as the beginning of 2020. This information was collected by combining information from [Wikidepida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cruise_ships) and [Vessel Finder](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels). The primary application of this data is for cruise tourism or cruise ship activity.

*Cruise Ships Activity at Port*

  > This dataframe estimates cruise ship activity by matching cruise ship GPS locations to port city geocodes within a 15 KM radius. The panel covers XX ports in XX countries globally from 2009 - 2019. Port Geocodes are a combination of ... three main sources... geocoded through [Google Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview). Cruise ship GPS acitvity was estimated through [Sail WX's](https://www.sailwx.info/shiptrack/) metadata.

*Forca a Comunidade e Crincas (FCC)*
 
  > This is the publically avaliable dataset for the "Strengthing Communities and Children" (FCC) dataset conducted by [Dean Yang](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/deanyang/) and his team starting in 2016 to present. As a member of his team, starting in 2020, I helped develop parts of this publically avaliable dataset. It monitors an RCT of HIV testing and various humanitrian aid related programs in Mozambique following the evaluation of the U.S.'s [PEPFAR](https://www.hiv.gov/federal-response/pepfar-global-aids/pepfar) program to address HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharran Africa. Additionally, it measures the impacts of Cyclone Idai and Covid-19's impact on affected study areas.

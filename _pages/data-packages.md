This page provides the publically avaliable datasets that I have created. Feel free to use them at your disposal, but if you would please cite your sources. A citation is provided for each dataframe. Note that some of the data listed below is not created by myself soley. Rather, some are datasets to which I have contributed towards. For these, please acknowledge all parties involved in the development of these datasets. For dataframes used in replicating my previous work, please refer to my [research page](/research/) where I try to provide access to the replication code and data for published work.

Additionally, this page houses statistical packages I have created. None are perfect, so feel free to email me feedback as well as feel free to log an issue on the source code housed on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/mcwayrm).

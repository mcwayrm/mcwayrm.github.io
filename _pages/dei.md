Currently, I sit on the [DEI Committee](https://isrdi.umn.edu/equity-diversity/dei) at the University of Minnesota, Institute for Social Research and Data Innovation (ISRDI). In this role, I have helped with the promotion of diverse scholars within the social science community. A major accomplishment of this committee being our Diversity Fellowship Program matching aspiring scholars from under-represented backgrounds with established reserachers and research projects at ISRDI. 

In my previous work as a research associate at the University Michigan, I have worked with several African scholars from Ghana, Malawi, and Mozambique. To support their further pursuit wihtin the economics profession, I have provided guidance as well as letters of support for them to pursue Master's programs and fellowships.

**Track Record on DEI**

- Describes multiple activities in depth, with detailed information about both their role in the activities and the outcomes. Activities may span research, teaching and service, and could include applying their research skills or expertise to investigating diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging.
- Organized or spoken at workshops or other events (depending on career stage) aimed at increasing others' understanding of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging as one aspect of their track record.

**Plans for Advancing DEI**


- Include a section on promoting pursuing a PhD for underrepresented groups in introductory economics course.
- Add a resources page to my personal website to democractize resources within the economics profession to level the playing field for those from under-resourced communities
- Continue to collaborate with partners within LMIC countries for my fieldwork. In doing so, promote their advancement within the field and encourage their collaboration as coauthors on relevant research.
